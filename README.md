# whack-a-kenny

Fun alternative to the whack-a-mole classic game created in approximately 5 hours ish, experimenting with Vue JS as a framwork.
The game stores the highest score, the numbers of clicks while in game and a timer set to 20 seconds and most elements are reactive.  

You can play the game on this link:
